## :star2: About the Project

<p>Our team wanted to win this project and build a brand new website for FCA. However our in-house design team created a fancy, modern design and I had to create a DEMO that was introduced for the leadership of FCA.</p>
<p>The DEMO had fully functional parts, such as login area, search feature, etc.</p>
<p>The content of the site was fully created by in-house CMS system.</p>
<p>A strict Cookie policy solution was introduced to fulfill the legal requirements.</p>
<p>Developing plugins for the TinyMCE editor was exclusively my task. All new plugins written by me were dedicated for special features, such as creating chemical formulas and convert into HTML5 shape, teasers, etc. Basket function was a harder part of the development as more variations the customer wanted to have.</p>
<p></p>

<p><h4>Features developed by me and my team:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>manage images, PDF files and other assets</li>
    <li>content management
      <ul>
        <li>create a page</li>
        <li>edit a page</li>
        <li>manage navigation</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>document management</li>
    <li>Cookie policy management throughout the entire website</li>
    <li>Location sensitive multi modal system</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
The final webapp was easy-to-access, user-friendly with a detailed search function. The site was full responsive with mobile-first approach.
</p>
<li>Bespoken TinyMCE plugins for creating and managing content and making repeated tasks simple and easy</li>

<!-- My contribution to the project -->

## :white_check_mark: My contribution to the project

My active participation helped the team to shape new ideas and way of coding. I always had new ideas to introduce into the business. Mentorating other developers was one of my daily tasks. Rest of my tasks were leading meetings, searching Government-related informations and solutions. We worked in 2 weeks Sprints and all deadlines were strictly kept and the project was finished within the budget.
