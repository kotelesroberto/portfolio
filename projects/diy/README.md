  <h1>DIY is my second second nature</h1>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Renovated my family home by myself (brought the parquette back to life by polishing, concreted external steps, done painting, done waterpipe-work, replaced electric system, replaced the whole heating system, done heat-isolation, built new interior design, etc.).
    </li>
    <li>
      I always do fix my car(s) whatever the issue is.
    </li>
    <li>
      In my freetime I do handyman tasks done in London (furniture assembly, electrical system fixings, repair electric goods on motherboard level such as TVs and laptops, install washing machines and other equipments)
    </li>
  </ul>
