<!-- My contribution to the project -->

## :white_check_mark: My contribution to the project

My active participation helped the team to shape new ideas and way of coding. I always had new ideas to introduce into the business. Mentorating other developers was one of my daily tasks. Rest of my tasks were leading meetings, searching Government-related informations and solutions. We worked in 2 weeks Sprints and all deadlines were strictly kept and the project was finished within the budget. There was no room of mistakes, it was the most strict project I ever worked.
