## :family: About the company

<p>
<strong>Ei Group plc</strong>, formerly known as <strong>Enterprise Inns</strong>, was a prominent UK-based pub company, operating a portfolio of leased and tenanted pubs across England and Wales. The company was headquartered in Solihull, West Midlands, and was listed on the London Stock Exchange until its acquisition by Stonegate Pub Company in March 2020
</p>

<section>
  <h3>Leased and Tenanted Pubs</h3>
  <p>Ei Group managed over 4,000 properties, primarily leased and tenanted pubs, offering individuals the opportunity to operate pubs without purchasing the freehold. These arrangements provided autonomy and support to pub operators.</p>
  <h3>Managed Operations</h3>
  <p>The company operated approximately 100 managed pubs, including brands like Bermondsey and Craft Union, providing a more hands-on approach to pub management. These establishments were directly operated by Ei Group.</p>
  <h3>Commercial Property Management</h3>
  <p>Ei Group managed a developing portfolio of commercial properties, leasing them to third parties on commercial property terms. This included providing asset management support for its leased and tenanted, and managed house businesses.</p>
  <h3>Investment in Pubs</h3>
  <p>Over five years, Ei Group invested over ยฃ250 million to support, invest in, and add value to pubs throughout England and Wales, enhancing the quality and appeal of its establishments.</p>
  <h3>Acquisition by Stonegate Pub Company</h3>
  <p>In March 2020, Ei Group plc was acquired by Stonegate Pub Company, marking the end of its independent operations. The acquisition added approximately 4,000 pubs to Stonegate's portfolio, making it the largest pub owner in the UK.</p>
