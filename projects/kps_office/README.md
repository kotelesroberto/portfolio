<!-- My contribution to the project -->

## :white_check_mark: My contribution to the project

<p>I joined as a freelancer to the KPS development team and in the first few days I had to pick up the in-house way of working and got to know the structure of the project.</p>
<p>I had to write codes to show up products on the product listing pages, also the image galleries.</p>
<p>My task was making the website full responsive and mobile-first. It was quite time-consuming as many small mistakes I've found in the stylesheets and I have created a logical, dynamic style-system that generates the perfect layout for all screen sizes.</p>
