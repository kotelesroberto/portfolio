## :star2: About the Project

<p>The project itself was about building a professional webapp for pharmacy-related user-queries. Using the proper chemical formulas was the key of our work. No room of mistakes! We used an in-house headless CMS, that was created for this project only. Everything was written by us, so the CMS was not a commercial one.
</p>
<p>Developing plugins for the TinyMCE editor was exclusively my task. All new plugins written by me were dedicated for special features, such as creating chemical formulas and convert into HTML5 shape, teasers, etc. Basket function was a harder part of the development as more variations the customer wanted to have.</p>
<p><h4>Features developed by me and my team:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>manage images, PDF files and other assets</li>
    <li>content management
      <ul>
        <li>create a page</li>
        <li>edit a page</li>
        <li>manage navigation</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>manage monographs</li>
    <li>document management</li>
    <li>all unique TinyMCE plugins for creating and managing content and making repeated tasks simple</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
The final webapp was easy-to-access, user-friiendly with a detailed search function. Every forumlas are displayed with proper indexes. The site was full responsive with mobile-first approach.
