<!-- My contribution to the project -->

## :white_check_mark: My contribution to the project

<p>This entire project belonged to me, from the beginning until the end of it. I had to manage the design team and had my hands on the design processes. After having the design FIGMA pages I created teh webapp from scratch and used Adobe A/B test to inject the solution into the AEM pages. Had to create an injection ruke as the solution (and its content) was developed for specific pages (for instance: comparison of mobile phones was only visible on smartphone pages). For testing during the develpoment phase I used BroswerStack and multiple real devices, also the in-built Chrome DevTools.</p>
<p>Based on the insights this comparison tool created a significant rise in sales that ended up in a visible extra profit for Samsung UK.</p>
