## :star2: About the project

<p>The project itself was about building a professional website for users with subscription. Based on their plan the users access to different level of contents and documents.
</p>
<p>The content of the site was fully created by in-house CMS system where the TinyMCE editor had bespoken plugins (developed by me) to make content management super easy: teasers, formulas, accordions, BF unique elements, etc. All formules are perfectly displayed on all screen.</p>
<p></p>

<p><h4>Features developed by me and my team:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>manage images, PDF files and other assets</li>
    <li>content management
      <ul>
        <li>create a page</li>

      </ul>
    </li>

## :white_check_mark: My contribution to the project

My active participation helped the team to shape new ideas and way of coding. I always had new ideas to introduce into the business. Mentorating other developers was one of my daily tasks. Rest of my tasks were leading meetings, searching Government-related informations and solutions. We worked in 2 weeks Sprints and all deadlines were strictly kept and the project was finished within the budget.
