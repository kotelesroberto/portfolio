## :star2: About the project

<p><strong>Six Storeys</strong> is a multi-level, boutique Soho venue blending dining, cocktails, and curated private spaces. Each floor offers a different mood—from relaxed entrance-level drinks to exclusive, inventive cocktail bars and fully-equipped event rooms. Designed around immersive interiors and artisanal offerings, it’s tailored for both casual nights out and elevated event experiences.</p>

<p><h4>What had to do?</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>create pixel-perfect layout for every devices, all screen sizes</li>
    <li>mobile first, full responsive</li>
    <li>all content comes from JSON file with asyncronous RestAPI call</li>
    <li></li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p><h4>Features of this project:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>this is a WordPress site</li>
    <li>integrated Shopify feature, developed by using Liquid templating</li>
    <li>pixel-perfect layout for every devices, all screen sizes</li>
    <li>mobile first, full responsive</li>
    <li>all content comes from  JSON file for optimized loading, generated from WordPress database</li>
    <li>optimized page loading time, compressed images, compressed JS content into one file, browser cache to store what was loaded once, so the solution saved bandwith for the next page load</li>
    <li>had to load the content from an XML/JSON file than process it (JSON stringify) and create a representation of the data in the memory</li>
  </ul>

The final webapp was easy-to-access, user-friendly and soooo cool! It was full responsive with mobile-first approach.

## :white_check_mark: My contribution to the project

<p>I had to build this website from a design file. The solution is done by using WordPress engine and pixel-perfect, full responsive frontend part. Also had to integrate Shopify functions (using Liquid templating) that is a massive part of the website. I kept my hands on each steps of the development and put the PMs, designers and developers to the same table, it was the guarantee of the final excellent product. My coding approaches made this project an outstanding, satisfying product that made the client happy.</p>
